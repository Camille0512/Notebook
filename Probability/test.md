# Geometric Distribution
## Definition
Geometric Distribution is a kind of discrete probability distribution. During the Bernoulli experiment, record the probability of the event A's occurrence is p, and the experiment stops until A occurs, the experiment times is X and the X obeies the distribution of:


$$P(X=k)=(1-p)^k-1$$
$\sum_{i=0}^N\int_{a}^{b}g(t,i)\text{d}t$
$\alpha$
