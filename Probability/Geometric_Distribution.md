# Geometric Distribution
### Definition

Geometric Distribution is a kind of **discrete probability distribution**. During the *Bernoulli experiment*, record the probability of the event A's occurrence is p, and the experiment stops until A occurs, the experiment times is X and the X obeies the distribution of:
$$
P(X=k)=(1-p)^{k-1}p,\
k=1,2,\cdots
$$
Then the variable X is called obeys the geometric distribution, recorded as:
$$
X\sim GE(p)
$$

### Expectation & Variance

#### 1. Expectation

$$
E[X]=\frac{1}{p}
$$

#### 2. Variance

$$
Var(X)=\frac{1-p}{p^2}
